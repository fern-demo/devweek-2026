## Creating a Project

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.taskboard.dev/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Backend Rewrite",
    "description": "Migrate from monolith to microservices"
  }'
```

## Listing Projects

```bash
curl https://api.taskboard.dev/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Assigning Tasks to a Project

When creating or updating a task, set `project_id`:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.taskboard.dev/tasks/TASK_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": "PROJECT_ID"}'
```

## Viewing Tasks in a Project

Filter the task list by `project_id`:

```bash
curl "https://api.taskboard.dev/tasks?project_id=PROJECT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Deleting a Project

<Warning>
Deleting a project also deletes all tasks associated with it. This action is irreversible.
</Warning>

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.taskboard.dev/projects/PROJECT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
