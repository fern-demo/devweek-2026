## Core Concepts

**Tasks** are the basic unit of work. Each task has a title, status, priority, and can be assigned
to a user and organized into a project.

**Projects** group related tasks together. Every task can optionally belong to a single project.

## Features

- **CRUD operations** on tasks and projects
- **Filtering** by status, priority, and project
- **Pagination** for large result sets
- **Bearer token authentication** via JWT
- **Type-safe SDKs** for TypeScript and Go
